<div>
<h1>Comparative between AngularJS and Angular2</h1>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
AngularJS 2.0 was announced at the ng-Europe conference 22-23. September 2014. The drastic changes in the 2.0 version created considerable controversy among developers. On April 30, 2015, the AngularJS developers announced that Angular 2 moved from Alpha to Developer Preview. AngularJS 2 can be downloaded from the official website. Angular 2 moved to Beta in December 2015, and the first release candidate was published in May 2016. The final version was released on September 14, 2016.<br/><br/>
Angular 2 is not a version upgrade, but a complete rewrite. The primary differences in Angular 2 over Angular 1 are:<br/><br/>
- Mobile development – desktop development is much easier when mobile performance issues are handled first<br/>
- Modularity – much core functionality has moved to modules, producing a lighter, faster core<br/>
- Modern browsers only – reducing the need for browser compatibility workarounds<br/>
- Angular 2 recommends the use of Microsoft's TypeScript language, which introduces the following improvements: <br/>
	· Class-based Object Oriented Programming<br/>
	· Static Typing<br/>
	· Generics<br/>
	· Lambdas<br/>
- TypeScript is a superset of ECMAScript 6, and is backwards compatible with ECMAScript 5 (i.e.: JavaScript). Angular 2 also includes the benefits of ES6: <br/>
	· Iterators<br/>
	· For/Of loops<br/>
	· Python-style generators<br/>
	· Reflection<br/>
- Improved dependency injection – bindings make it possible for dependencies to be named<br/>
- Dynamic loading<br/>
- Asynchronous template compilation<br/>
- Simpler Routing<br/>
- Diary.js logging – measures where time is spent, to identify bottlenecks<br/>
- Replacing controllers and $scope with components and directives – a component is a directive with a template<br/>
- Reactive programming support using RxJS<br/>
